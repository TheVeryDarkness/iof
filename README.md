This library is mainly for some cases that need simple and fast I/O, such as online judge.

This library has an interface for inputs that is a bit similar to input streams in C++ (thus is helpful if you're finding an I/O framework in Rust for online judge), and some default format for output.

See the [documentation](https://docs.rs/iof) for more details.
